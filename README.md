sicCubeMonitoring
==================

Some basic scripts I put together to monitor ASIC Miner Cubes

While fully functional (on my network, YMMV), they are still works in progress and lack even the most basic error checking.

To use make sure arp-ping is installed, your mail works, and that whatever user you are running them as can password-lessly sudo arp-ping (unless your distro doesnt require it, in which case you need to edit out the sudo statement).
